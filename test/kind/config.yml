networking:
  # Using 0.0.0.0 since the dind container running the kind image
  # will accept connections coming to any ip of the dind machine.
  # if we leave it 127.0.0.1 then outside communucation cant be established.
  # in practice each gitlab runner has the ip of the docker dind mapped in its /etc/hosts
  # so each connection is sent to docker_dind_ip:kind_port. because the inner kind container
  # accepts all connections coming to the dind local ips, it will accept the connection.
